									Quantum Computing

								<a href="./final-report.pdf" class="btn btn-primary"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Report</a>
								<p class="card-text">
									In Summer 2021, I spent time with Professor Peter Schupp and another undergraduate student on research about <i>Quantum Computing</i>. Quantum Computing is an emergent technology that uses quantum parallelism, entanglement, and other quantum effects to speed up computations and allow tackling problems that would otherwise forever be out of reach for even the fastest supercomputers. If successful, the implications would be truly revolutionary, but many technical hurdles remain.<br>

									In my internship on Quantum Computing, we did research on state of the art in hardware, algorithms, applications, and quantum computing programming languages. Besides these, our main focus was to understand the today's technical difficulties in developing a scalable quantum computer. Different models such as using superconducting qubits (implemented by Google), ion-trapped method, photonic quantum computation, semiconductor qubits, and topological qubits were our primary focus of research. Their technical implementations and difficulties in developing a scalable quantum computer were researched. Few known quantum algorithms were studied and implemented in IBM's quantum computer. The major part of the internship was focused on study of quantum cellular automata, which is another model for quantum computation. Various models and their realization to simulate a quantum circuit or quantum Turing machine was the primary focus of the internship.<br> Alike to any research, documentation of research, slides preparation, and presentations were subroutines tasks that were carried out perfectly.

								<p class="card-text">
								I find myself spending lot of time in "shallow work", in fact, structuring the lab report, structuring table in \(\LaTeX\), lot of arithmetic calculations, and recalculating them if they go wrong. I had to plan ahead for the weekend to be spending time doing "shallow work". Thus, I decided to do some research on this. I have compiled the resources altogether that could be of use for any student writing report for the lab work. I have tried as much as I can to automate most of the tasks such that the primary time of lab is focused on learning than in organizing. At some point in future, I'll upload VimTex configuration file combined with Python work with additional features, which I are coming up.</p>
								<h6 class="title">Social Web-Application at Jacobs</h6>
								<p class="card-text">
								After social restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, I with two other undergraduate
								students decided to reinstill the campus culture. We then created alike any other social
								media but customized to organize campus activities. Students can join any social clubs and get
								participated with their activities right from their own room. Organizers had the provision to make
								posts, notify the club members and maintain administrative tasks. We had a sense that we were
								successful in part to engage students in socai activities despite the pandemic.</p>
